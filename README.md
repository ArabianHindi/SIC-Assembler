# SIC-Assembler
This is a pass one and pass two assembler that takes an input text file and generates the location counter and object code along with the HTE record of the input text file.
-In the added repository you will find the Assembler along with a sample input text file.
# To run this project
I used Netbeans IDE and in the java file just adjust the location of the sample text file and you are good to go.
